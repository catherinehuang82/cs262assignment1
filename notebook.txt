=============================================================================
- Got a basic connection/messaging service working!
    - Beween one server and one client
- Questions
    - How to know which ports are available to connect to?
- Things to add/fix
    - Currently assumes server and client must message back and forth:
      one side waits until the other responds to be able to send a message.
      We should allow people to message without waiting.
    - Need to keep track of multiple users with usernames and make threads
      for each one. Be able to list accounts. Specify which user you want to
      send a message to when sending messages.
    - Implement ability to delete accounts.
    - Implement queueing messages for users that are not currently logged in.
    - Implement error for nonexistent users.
