=============================================================================
- Got a basic connection/messaging service working!
    - Beween one server and one client
- Questions
    - How to know which ports are available to connect to?
    - What kind of text wildcards do we need to support? (Wrt #2 on the spec)
        - Are prefixes/suffixes/substrings enough? Or do we need to support more complicated stuff like regexp?
        - One group is using tries, but these only support prefix/suffix
    - How to exit from chat — is newline “\n” fine?
    - When can the user list accounts? Should the user be able to trigger this feature anytime using a certain message string? Or does the user only need to be able to do this before they connect to a client/server?
- Things to add/fix
    - Currently assumes server and client must message back and forth:
      one side waits until the other responds to be able to send a message.
      We should allow people to message without waiting.
    - Need to keep track of multiple users with usernames and make threads
      for each one. Be able to list accounts. Specify which user you want to
      send a message to when sending messages.
    - Implement ability to delete accounts.
    - Implement queueing messages for users that are not currently logged in.
    - Implement error for nonexistent users.
